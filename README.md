In this project, i built a React JS application centered on cryptocurrencies. I used hooks such as useState, useEffect while using axios to interact with the coin Gecko API. Also used react-router-dom to have dynamic routes. Used the useParam hook to pass data as parameters, also used domPurify to prevent cross tag scripting.
